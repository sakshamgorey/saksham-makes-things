# Hello, World! üåç

Welcome to **sakshammakesthings**, my little corner of the digital universe where I share my thoughts, experiments, and creations.

## What to Expect

This blog will be a space where I explore:

- **Technology & Development** - My journey through code, frameworks, and digital tools
- **Creative Projects** - Experiments with design, art, and digital creation
- **Thoughts & Ideas** - Reflections on the intersection of technology and creativity
- **Tutorials & Guides** - Sharing what I learn along the way

## Why "sakshammakesthings"?

The name reflects my philosophy: **making things** is at the heart of learning and growth. Whether it's code, art, music, or ideas, the act of creation teaches us more than passive consumption ever could.

## The Space Theme

You'll notice this blog has a space theme - not because I'm particularly obsessed with astronomy (though it is fascinating), but because space represents:

- **Infinite possibilities** - Just like the digital realm
- **Exploration** - The constant journey of discovery
- **Beauty in simplicity** - The elegance of fundamental principles
- **Connection** - How everything is interconnected

## What's Next?

I'm excited to share my journey with you. Expect posts about:

- Building this very blog with Next.js and modern web technologies
- Experiments with AI and creative coding
- Thoughts on the future of digital creation
- Tutorials and guides for fellow makers

Stay tuned, and thanks for joining me on this adventure! üöÄ
